/* Plan
 * 0. Setup
 *   a. Zoom out all the way for optimal window detection. (This scales down lighting effects on changed pixels.)
 * 1. Purchase Steel Mining Pick (check character api to see if at least 100 count is already owned/equipped)
 *   a. Move to merchant
 *   b. Find vendor window
 *     1. Take screenshot
 *     2. Press 'F'
 *     3. Take screenshot
 *     4. Find largest rectangle where every single contained pixel was changed
 *   c. Find Steel Mining Pick (3rd from bottom)
 *     1. Move mouse to bottom center of vendor window (a few pixels up to make sure it's inside)
 *     2. Take screenshot
 *     3. Move mouse up a few pixels
 *     4. Wait for highlight animation
 *     5. Take screenshot
 *     6. Check for a 3x100 row of entirely new pixels to the right of the mouse
 *     7. If found, this is a new vendor item from the bottom.
 *        If not found, this is the same vendor item or not an item at all yet.
 *     8. Repeat 2-8 until 3 new vendor items are found.
 *   d. Double click to purchase
 * 2. Equip Steel Mining Pick (check character api to see if it's already equipped)
 *   a. Find inventory window
 *     1. Take screenshot
 *     2. Press 'I'
 *     3. Take screenshot
 *     4. Find largest rectangle where every single contained pixel was changed
 *   b. Find search box
 *     1. Move mouse to top center of inventory window (a few pixels down to make sure it's inside)
 *     2. Take screenshot
 *     3. Click
 *     4. Take screenshot
 *     5. Check for new light pixel between the left edge of the inventory window and the mouse
 *     6. If found, verify a short column of new light pixels are there. This is where the cursor is.
 *        If not found, move the mouse down a few pixels and repeat 2-6.
 *   c. Type "Steel Mining Pick"
 *   d. Move the mouse to where the cursor was found, right a few pixels, and down a few pixels (measure an approximate distance for this)
 *   e. Double click to equip
 *   f. Verify that a Steel Mining Pick is now equipped.
 * 3. Find mining nodes
 *   a. Turn off all map icons
 *   b. Walk along route
 *   c. Screenshot minimap
 *   d. Compare minimap to tile map
 *     1. If There are a cluster of pixels that are all significantly different from the corresponding nearby pixels, there must be an icon here
 *     2. Check the color of the icon to know which type of resource node it is
 *
